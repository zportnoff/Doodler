CMSC434 Doodle App

To run this program, import it into Android Studio and press run. You can start drawing once the app loads. There is a menu to access settings such as brush size, color, and opacity. The special feature that I implemented was the "Get Fancy?" button that changes the color of the line rapidly as it is drawn. I used the android api and stackoverflow answers to assist me in creating the menu functionality.
